# Geometric-Structures
Package for computing 
- the complete hyperbolic structure by giving equations for edge and crossing labels (1 in the menu) and their complex values (2 in the menu) for a hyperbolic link in 3-sphere;
- equations for the canonical component of PSL(2, C)-character variety (3 in the menu)
of a hyperbolic knot in 3-sphere.
The link/knot diagram needs to be taut (e.g. any reduced alternating diagram is taut) and can be given as Dowker-Thisletwhaite (DT) code or planar diagram (PD) code (the latter only for alternating links).
Computing  2 and 3 above are based on this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0510; 3 is based on the upcoming preprint by K. Petersen, A. Tsvietkova. The equations for 3 can be large, and are hence recorded in a txt file in the folder with the code.
There is Python code and an exe file (the latter is for Windows). 
Most of the code was written by Jaeyun Bae, Dale Koenig, Anastasiia Tsvietkova.
Other people have also worked on maintaining/improving the code: Alex Lowen, Mark Bell.
